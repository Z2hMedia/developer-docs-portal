Game Events
======

All Biba games emit events to PubSub on the "games" topic. The events are all
defined in [games.proto](games.proto). 

## Sending Events

**Only the games should be sending events to PubSub!**

### Google Cloud Function Proxy

The URL for the proxy is `https://games.bibabots.com/v1/events`. The JSON to
send for each type of event is documented later in this README file.

## Attributes

This is a mostly-comprehensive list of all attributes that should be sent with
every event:

* `env` - if the game was compiled as a developer version ('dev'), or is a
  production game out in the wild ('prod')
* `app` - the name of the application ( ie, 'biba-collection', 'biba-dhx-2d' )
* `game` - short name of the game ( ie, 'drive', 'collectobots', etc)
* `userId` - Firebase user id
* `deviceId` - Unique device id ( aka, `udid` )
* `deviceModel` - Model of the device ( 'iPhone 8', 'Android', etc -- should be
  provided by Unity )
* `deviceLanguage` - Name of the language the game is currently set to
* `os` - OS of the device -- provided by Unity
* `timestamp` - (RFC 3339 formatted timestamp)[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339] -- your language should be
  able to generate these without any issue
* `version` - version of the game that generated this event
* `metaType` - the games meta type (explained below)

Each event also has a `type`, which specifies what kind of event it is. The
values for `type` are documented below along with each event type.

### Meta Type

In order to allow the partitioning of events from games for projects like "Biba
For Schools", we have the `metaType` field.

The default value is `biba`.

Currently, the only application which has a different value for this field are
the games included in the "Biba For Schools" bundle.

### Location

If the user has allowed us to use their device location, the following attribute should also be set:

When sending via PubSub directly, the location must be set as an attribute, like
so:

* `location` - a JSON object, with two fields: `latitude` & `longitude`

Example:
```json
"location": {
  "latitude": 49.13234,
  "longitude": -121.203423
},
```

### Duration Format

When sending the duration of a session ( or any event that tracks duration, such
as mini games or equipment use ), there are two options for how to send the
information:

* in milliseconds
* duration string format

If the value in `sessionLength` is just a number, it will be parsed as a
duration in milliseconds.

Otherwise, you can pass a duration string. A duration string is a possibly
signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit
suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or
"Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h" ( for nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds,
seconds, minutes, hours ).

## Data

The data sent depends on the type of event. Below is the current list of events,
along with their value for the `type` attribute, and what they should send in `data**.

### Activity

When the application has collected LMV data, it is sent using this event.

**Example Data:**
```json

### Custom

When a game needs to send some data not already covered by the other events in
this document, this is the event that should be used.

event type.
